To download the data:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moonfallidk/bug-bite-images
1. Click download
2. ⁠Unzip the file
3. ⁠Go to the root of our repository and create a data/ folder
4. ⁠Add the unzipped folder bug_bite_images inside data/
⁠I already made a gitignore to ignore anything in the data/ folder so it should not get committed to github
