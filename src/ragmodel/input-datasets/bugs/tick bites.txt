You can reduce your risk of tick bites by wearing bug spray, covering your skin and checking yourself and your pets for ticks.

Overview:

What Are Tick Bites?

Tick bites are areas on your skin where a tick has latched onto you with its mouthparts. This can sometimes leave a mark or rash. But often, the bite isn’t noticeable at all, unless you catch the tick while it’s still attached. Tick bites can be dangerous because they can spread potentially serious diseases.

Ticks are small, wingless bugs that usually live in the woods or tall grass. They bite people and animals to feed off of their blood. They’re tiny — sometimes as small as a poppy seed — and hard to see on your skin. And you probably won’t feel them bite you, either.

Unlike mosquitoes, ticks don’t just bite and run. They bury their heads into your skin. Then, they feed off your blood for hours or even days. As they fill with blood, they go from flat to rounded. The bites aren’t always harmful on their own. But while a tick is feeding on you, they can transmit bacteria, parasites and viruses into your blood.

Types of tick-borne illnesses
Tick bites can cause:

Alpha-gal syndrome, a reaction to tick spit that causes an allergy to red meat
Anaplasmosis
Babesiosis
Colorado tick fever, a viral infection that can cause a fever, muscle aches and brain inflammation
Ehrlichiosis
Heartland virus disease
Lyme disease, the most common tick-borne illness in the U.S.
Powassan virus
Relapsing fever, a bacterial infection that causes recurring fevers and other symptoms
Rocky Mountain spotted fever
Southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI), a condition with symptoms similar to Lyme disease
Tick paralysis, a nerve condition caused by neurotoxins in the tick’s spit
Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE)
Tularemia

Symptoms and Causes:

Symptoms of tick-borne illnesses

Symptoms of conditions caused by tick bites could include:

Fever
Chills
Muscle pain
Headaches
Tiredness
Itchiness or irritation
Nausea and vomiting
Swollen lymph nodes
Allergic reaction to eating red meat
Skin rash
The rash might look like a circle or a bullseye. Or it might be small, red or purplish spots that are actually spots of blood under your skin (petechiae).

What does a tick bite look like?

Tick bites themselves often don’t cause noticeable symptoms like mosquito bites do. Sometimes, they might cause a bump, swelling or itching. You most often know you were bitten by a tick because you catch them attached to you.

Where on your body do ticks bite?

Ticks can climb onto any part of your body. But they often move to warm, moist areas to latch on. Common places on your body to find ticks include:

On your scalp and neck
In your groin
Behind your knees
In your belly button
In or around your ears
In your armpits
Around your waist
Why do ticks bite?
Ticks bite because blood is their source of food. Young ticks (nymphs) hatch in spring and find an animal or person to feed off of. They mature into adults and take another meal in the fall. Tick bites are most common in spring, early summer and fall, but you can get bitten anytime.

Management and Treatment:

What should you do about a tick bite?

If you notice a tick biting you, you can remove it with these steps:

Gently clean the area around the tick with a cotton ball soaked in rubbing alcohol or warm, soapy water.
Use rounded-end tweezers to gently but firmly pinch the tick near its head, as close to your skin as possible. Don’t crush the tick’s body (this can push more germs into your body) or touch it with your hands.
Take note (or a good photo) of what the tick looks like. Is it flat or rounded (engorged)? Does it have markings on its back? Save it in a container if you can. This can help your provider know how long the tick was biting you and how likely it is that it transmitted diseases.
Wash the bite area thoroughly with soap and water.
If you’re unsure how long the tick was attached or if you develop symptoms, contact your provider.
Don’t use kerosene, petroleum jelly (like Vaseline®) or a lit match to remove the tick.

Tick-borne disease treatment
Certain tick-borne illnesses are treated with antibiotics or antiparasitics. For others, there are no specific treatments.

Prevention:

Can tick bites be prevented?

You can reduce your risk of tick bites by:

Avoiding long grass and woods: Keep your grass cut shorter than 5 inches. Stay near the center of cleared paths while in wooded areas.
Using bug spray: Check to make sure it contains DEET, picaridin, IR3535 or other ingredients approved to keep ticks away. Sources like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have guides that can help you find the repellent that’s right for you.
Covering your skin: Cover as much of your skin as possible with clothing when you’re in areas that might have ticks. This includes long pants, long sleeves and socks.
Checking yourself for ticks: Pay special attention to areas where ticks like to hide on your body. If possible, have someone else check you in places you can’t see yourself (like your back and scalp). Do this every morning and evening to limit the amount of time a tick might be attached to you.
Checking your pets, too: Pets can bring ticks into your house. Check your pets for ticks often, especially after they’ve been outside. You can also ask your veterinarian about the best way to protect your pets from ticks.
Preparing for travel: Before traveling, talk to your travel healthcare clinic or provider, or check with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Consider getting vaccinated against tick-borne encephalitis if you’re planning on traveling to an area where it spreads.

What are the different kinds of ticks?
Some of the most common ticks in the U.S. include:

Blacklegged tick (deer tick). Deer ticks are usually black with areas of reddish-brown or white on their backs, depending on whether they’re adults or nymphs.
Dog tick (wood tick). Dog ticks have whitish markings on their backs. Adults are slightly larger than deer ticks.
Lone Star tick. Adult female Lone Star ticks have a distinctive white dot on their backs. Males and nymphs are brown or reddish with black markings.
