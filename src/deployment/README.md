CURRENT ISSUES:
1. Frontend container is failing to start because we are using a dev container and running npm start at runtime. The production dockerfile does not work. Will need to work on this once frontend is ready, following the template from the class.
2. Image from vl model is not found in the registry although i see it. Irith could you try to repushit if you have a working version? I cannot as my image occupies 24GB.
3. Maybe other issues that will arise.

IMPORTANT: PLACE THE TWO JSONS FROM WHATSAPP IN YOUR SECRETS FOLDER. IF you get SSH related errors, follow the instructions in the dlops-readme to setup your gcloud environment.
